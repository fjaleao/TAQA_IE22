well hello this is Jack from to fluesy.com and this is the two flimsy podcast where you can learn English with me on YouTube and soon-to-be on of the podcast areas or apps let site now today we are going to talk about deliberate linen versus passive learning and more specifically why you need to embrace difficult moments why you need to learn to love when things got a little bit difficult with your learning so I think this episode is going to be very valuable for you and you're going to learn a lot I'm not the end I'm just going to go over my favorite method which ties everything together which was summarized what I'm talkin about in this episode I'm also going to give you some examples from my life as well which will help you understand just the important it's off this concept of embracing when things get difficult not to embrace something means to Lynn to live at to see as a positive thing instead of a negative thing about these Concepts you are watching a TV program in English and you are just naturally get in the input which I taught by Ally so important to get him because that's how you're going to really absorb English and just get you do the English language but learning grammar rules when you focus on learning new words and phrases when you use a message I'm going to talk about later when you try to learn how to say a word that is difficult for you to say and you practice this a few times and you practice again next week that is deliberate learning now deliberate learning needs more focus it needs more Focus because you are watching a YouTube video in English you can sometimes just switch off maybe you're doing this when you're clean the house or on your way to work or when you're exercising and you can move to task a little bit with this because you don't need all of your focus all of the time it's watching a video listening to something while doing other things
