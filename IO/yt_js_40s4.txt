not yet be in every project it also comes with its own test-run or similar to Jess and as you might imagine it's fast so might even call it a blazingly fast sounds awesome but keep in mind this project is in its infancy there will be bugs if you're on Windows you'll have to use WSL that even that gave me some issues but overall my final analysis on bun is that this thing is busson no cap for real this is been the code report thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one
