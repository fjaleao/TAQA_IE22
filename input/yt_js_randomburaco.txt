well first of all it doesn't use the V8 engine but instead uses javascriptcore from webkit which is generally considered to be faster but more difficult to work with an addition it's written in a low level programming language called Zig this is a relatively new language that's similar to see or rust and the creators of bun say the lack of hidden control flow makes it much simpler to write fast off where it's going to go fast but more importantly bun is an all-in-one run time it has a native bundler to replace tools like webpack and also has a native transpiler so you can write typescript code out-of-the-box with cool features like top-level away and I did it already been pioneered by Dino but bun will also try and file your JS X-Files also supporting many node core modules
